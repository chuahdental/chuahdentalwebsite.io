<p>As a clinical dental hygienist at Chuah Dental Clinic, my mission has always been to preserve and maintain bone health. However, when I received a diagnosis of osteoporosis, it prompted me to delve into extensive research on this destructive disease and advocate for early detection.</p>

<p><strong>Unveiling Osteoporosis:</strong></p>
<p>Osteoporosis, characterized by weakened bone tissue and increased fracture risk, is a chronic metabolic bone disease. At Chuah Dental Clinic, we emphasize that osteoporosis is not only age-dependent but also linked to genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors, making early detection crucial.</p>

<p><strong>The Silent Killer:</strong></p>
<p>Often dubbed the "silent killer," osteoporosis disproportionately affects women, being four times more likely in women than men. Asian or Non-Hispanic White women are particularly at risk. With a faster rate of bone loss in women, especially postmenopausal, hormonal changes play a critical role. This silent disease can lead to life-altering fractures if not detected early.</p>

<p><strong>New Screening Guidelines:</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally seen as a disease of the aging population, osteoporosis may have early signs that go unnoticed. Chuah Dental Clinic supports the latest recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force, advocating screening for younger patients at increased risk. Early detection, facilitated by tools like FRAX, is key to intervention and treatments.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Factors and Oral Health:</strong></p>
<p>Many risk factors for osteoporosis, such as smoking, family history, and sedentary lifestyle, are mirrored in oral health. Studies indicate a link between osteoporosis and periodontal disease, emphasizing the shared risk factors and inflammation. Dental professionals at Chuah Dental Clinic are committed to early detection to preserve overall bone health.</p>

<p><strong>How We Help:</strong></p>
<p>At Chuah Dental Clinic, we go beyond the traditional scope of dentistry. Our focus on early detection includes examining jaw health as part of routine dental assessments. With shared risk factors between oral health and osteoporosis, we play a vital role in advocating for preventive measures and overall well-being.</p>
